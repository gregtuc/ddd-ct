# ddd-ct - Domain-Driven Design Collaboration Tool (DDD-CT)

### Quickstart
* Windows
    * set CGO_ENABLED=1
    * go run ./cmd/webserver

### Overview 
In theory, domain-driven design is a fantastic toolkit and approach that can transform a teams approach to software design and the resulting effectiveness and collaboration for all teams, from product to development, for a given project. In practice, it's a far more messy experience where meetings can devolve and get side-tracked on details that don't matter.

This tool aims to create a more structured approach to the genesis of domain-driven design (DDD) for a given project.

### Core Features:

* Idea Boards: Similar to digital whiteboards, these are spaces where participants can post ideas. However, they're organized into DDD-specific categories such as "Domains," "Subdomains," "Bounded Contexts," and "Ubiquitous Language."
* Context Mapping Workshop: An interactive module that guides the team through creating context maps. This helps in identifying bounded contexts and the relationships between them, which is a key component of DDD.
* Ubiquitous Language Glossary: A collaborative glossary where terms are defined and refined. This ensures that all team members share a common language, reducing confusion and aligning understanding.
* Modeling Workshops: Facilitated sessions within the app that guide the team through exercises in Event Storming or Example Mapping to identify domain events, commands, aggregates, and entities.
* Priority Voting: To keep discussions focused, the tool includes a feature for voting on ideas or models that should be prioritized. This helps in focusing the discussion on what matters most to the project.
* Integration with Project Management Tools: Seamless integration with tools like JIRA, Trello, or Asana to convert agreed-upon ideas and models into actionable tasks.
* Real-time Collaboration: Allowing team members to collaborate in real-time, including video and chat functions, to facilitate remote or distributed team participation.
* Feedback and Revision History: Every piece of the model or idea can receive feedback from team members, with a revision history to track how ideas evolve over time.
* Learning Resources: To support teams new to DDD, the tool provides access to resources, best practices, and case studies on DDD implementation.

### Implementation Considerations:

* User Interface: The UI should be intuitive, minimizing the learning curve and encouraging adoption by the team.
* Scalability: As projects grow, the tool should easily scale to accommodate more users, more complex domain models, and integration with other tools.
* Security: Given the potentially sensitive nature of the discussions, robust security measures are essential to protect company intellectual property.
* This tool aims to bring structure and focus to the brainstorming process by leveraging DDD principles, thereby enhancing collaboration and ensuring that discussions contribute effectively to the project's goals.
